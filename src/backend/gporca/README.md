Welcome to GPORCA, the Greenplum Next Generation Query Optimizer!

To understand the objectives and architecture of GPORCA please refer to the following articles:
* [Orca: A Modular Query Optimizer Architecture for Big Data](https://content.pivotal.io/white-papers/orca-a-modular-query-optimizer-architecture-for-big-data).
* [Profiling Query Compilation Time with GPORCA](http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/orca-profiling/)

# First Time Setup

## Build and install GPORCA

ORCA is built automatically with GPDB as long as `--disable-orca` is not used.
<a name="test"></a>

## Test GPORCA

The GPORCA unit tests use the `gporca_prove` utility as the driver to run the
tests. It is a wrapper around the standard perl `prove` program which is also
used to run the TAP tests in GPDB.

To test GPORCA, first go into the `gporca` directory and build GPORCA and the
test executable, `gporca_test`:

```
make gporca_test
```

To run all GPORCA tests, use the `gporca_prove` command from the gporca directory
after build finishes.

```
./gporca_prove --schedule=tap-schedule.txt
```

The test are also run automatically as part of the `unittest-check` make target,
along with all the other GPDB unit tests.

Much like `make`, `prove` has a -j option that allows running multiple tests in
parallel to save time. Using it is recommended for faster testing.

```
./gporca_prove --schedule=tap-schedule.txt -j8
```

By default, `gporca_prove` does not print the output of failed tests. To print the
output of failed tests, use the `--verbose` flag like so (this is
useful for debugging failed tests):

```
./gporca_prove --schedule=tap-schedule.txt -j8 --verbose
```

To run only the previously failed tests, you can use `prove`'s option to save the
list of tests. First run the tests with:
```
./gporca_prove --schedule=tap-schedule.txt -j8 --state=save
```

You can then re-run the failed tests with:
```
./gporca_prove --schedule=tap-schedule.txt -j8 --state=failed
```

To run a specific individual test:

```
./gporca_prove CAggTest
```

To run a specific minidump, for example for `data/dxl/minidump/TVFRandom.mdp`:
```
./gporca_prove data/dxl/minidump/TVFRandom.mdp
```

Note that some tests use assertions that are only enabled for DEBUG builds, so
DEBUG-mode tests tend to be more rigorous.

## Adding tests

Most of the regression tests come in the form of a "minidump" file.
A minidump is an XML file that contains all the input needed to plan a query,
including information about all tables, datatypes, and functions used, as well
as statistics. It also contains the resulting plan.

A new minidump can be created by running a query on a live GPDB server:

1. Run these in a psql session:

```
set client_min_messages='log';
set optimizer=on;
set optimizer_enumerate_plans=on;
set optimizer_minidump=always;
set optimizer_enable_constant_expression_evaluation=off;
```

2. Run the query in the same psql session. It will create a minidump file
   under the "minidumps" directory, in the master's data directory:

```
$ ls -l $MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY/minidumps/
total 12
-rw------- 1 heikki heikki 10818 Jun 10 22:02 Minidump_20160610_220222_4_14.mdp
```

3. Run xmllint on the minidump to format it better, and copy it under the
   data/dxl/minidump directory:

```
xmllint --format $MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY/minidumps/Minidump_20160610_220222_4_14.mdp > data/dxl/minidump/MyTest.mdp
```

4. Add it to the test suite, in server/src/unittest/gpopt/minidump/CICGTest.cpp

## Update tests

In some situations, a failing test does not necessarily imply that the fix is
wrong. Occasionally, existing tests need to be updated. There is now a script
that allows for users to quickly and easily update existing mdps. This script
takes in a logfile that it will use to update the mdps. This logfile can be
obtained from running `gporca_prove` as shown below.

Existing minidumps can be updated by running the following:


1. Run `./gporca_prove -j8 --state=save`.

2. If there are failing tests, run
```
./gporca_prove --state=failed -D > /tmp/failures.out
```

3. The output file can then be used with the `fix_mdps.py` script.
```
./scripts/fix_mdps.py /tmp/failures.out
```
Note: This will overwrite existing mdp files. This is best used after
committing existing changes, so you can more easily see the diff.
Alternatively, you can use `scripts/fix_mdps.py --dryRun` to not change
mdp files

4. Ensure that all changes are valid and as expected.

# Advanced Setup

## Explicitly Specifying Xerces For Build

If you want to build with a custom version of Xerces, is recommended to use the
`--prefix` option to the Xerces-C configure script to install Xerces in a
location other than the default under `/usr/local/`, because you may have other
software that depends on the platform's version of Xerces-C. Installing in a
non-default prefix allows you to have GP-Xerces installed side-by-side with
unpatched Xerces without incompatibilities.
